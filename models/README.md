# Model Module

This module contains the implementation of various models used in the
AirBnB clone project.

# Base Model

The `BaseModel` class serves as the base class for all other models in the
 project.
 It provides common attributes and methods that are inherited by other models.
  Some of the key features of the `BaseModel` class include:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each instance of a model.
- `created_at`: The date and time when an instance is created.
- `updated_at`: The date and time when an instance is last updated.
- `to_dict()`: A method that converts an instance to a dictionary
representation.

# City

The `City` class represents a city in the AirBnB clone project. It inherits from
 the `BaseModel` class and adds additional attributes specific to a city,
  such as the city name and state.

# Place

The `Place` class represents a place or accommodation in the AirBnB clone
 project.
 It also inherits from the `BaseModel` class and includes attributes such as the
  place name, description, price, and number of rooms.

# State

The `State` class represents a state in the AirBnB clone project.
 It inherits from the `BaseModel` class and includes attributes such as the
 state name.

# User

The `User` class represents a user in the AirBnB clone project.
 It inherits from the `BaseModel` class and includes attributes such as the 
 user's email and password.

# Engine Module

The `engine` module contains the file storage implementation for the
AirBnB clone project.
 It includes classes and methods for storing and retrieving data from files.
 The key class in this module is the `FileStorage` class, which provides methods
 for serializing and deserializing objects to and from JSON format.
